# Spacecraft Simulation README

## Introduction
Welcome to the Spacecraft Simulation! This project involves a simulation of a spacecraft using Python and the Pygame library. The simulation show the movement on a speceshuttle, along with fuel consumption and interaction with a celestial body (moon).

## Execution
To run the simulation:
1. Be shure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install necessary libraries by running:
    ```
    pip install numpy pygame
	pip install numpy
	pip install time
	pip install random
	pip install math
    ```
3. Download the `Spacecraft_Simulation.py` file.
4. Open it in your preferred Python environment (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
5. Execute the program, make the inputs and the simulation window will appear.

## Description
The code begins with the definition of spacecraft dimensions and the initiation of the Pygame simulation. It sets up a grid, establishes the spacecraft's initial coordinates, and includes a fuel mechanism that depletes over time. The simulation simulates the spacecraft's movement and fuel reduction.

## Features
- Grid-based simulation with spacecraft movement.
- Fuel consumption mechanism with a visual representation.
- Randomly generated stars on the grid.
- Interaction with a moon-like celestial body.

## Usage
- Observe fuel consumption, displayed in the console.
- The simulation ends when the spacecraft runs out of fuel or goes out of bounds.
- For correct ussage of the program, you should use razonable dimensions, here some examples: 
```
	Saturn V Radius 5, height 110
	Space shuttle Radius 6 height 37
	SLS Radius 4  height 98
	Starship Radius 4,5 height 120
```
## FAQ
Common errors: -Use only numbers, no letters of units. -Dont leave the space empty. -Wrong name file. Be shure you are putting the correct code to initializate.
